# AmazonPriceTracker
A web-app built using Django to alert users of future price drops

To run this project, you will need to install all the appropriate dependencies

### Step 1
Create and activate a virtual environment. If not sure how to do so, refer to https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/

### Step 2
Install all the dependencies. Navigate to the outer ProjectFolder with the "requirements.txt" file and execute the following command
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Step 3
Configure ProjectFolder/settings.py to send emails. The easiest way is via a google account. You will have to enable your google account for this via [this setting](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps). Then fill in the settings shown before

```
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = '' #The email you will be sending from

EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
EMAIL_HOST_USER = '' #The email you will be sending from
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = '' #Password for your email
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
```

### Step 4
Start the background script
```
python manage.py startserver
```
This script will run in the background and will
1. Crawl all the products in the database daily and
2. Alert the appropriate users in case of any price drops

### Step 5
Launch the project
```
python manage.py runserver --noreload --nothreading
```

Now the project is fully functional. Visit the url generated by the above command to interact with the web app.
