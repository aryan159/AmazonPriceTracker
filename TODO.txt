So...celery is not supported on windows huh. Actual wtf moment
Current workaround solution:
1. Create seperate scripts for all of our needs (currently only DailyWebScraper, screw URLChecker)
2. Run all of them on seperate terminal windows before running runserver

Should we really bother about hosting right now? heroku does not support sqlite3 whic python anywhere does not support heroku.
Let's just finish a working model with django + celery right now, make a short video about it, post it on GitHub, along with challenges, etc and start applying for jobs ASAP

TODO on 031221
- add form to index.html to accept product url
- check if URL valid (able to extract price), then add ASIN in db if not already present
- redirect to /product/{ASIN}
- add form to /product/{ASIN} to accept email for tracking price
- add table to /product/{ASIN} showing price history

TODO on 041221
- host it 

Things to resolve
- URLChecker Reactornotrestartable

- Amazon has a 10-digit identifier for each product, for eg "B081V6W99V"
- Find products in database by their 10-digit identifier
- Display price history in a table format
- Email users about price drops
- Build models
- Implement sessions
- Implement a "Which products are other users tracking" page
- Stylize


- Decided to do a very rough implementation of the regular price tracking
    - Activate the script when /activate url is visited
    - Script runs every 24 hours by running in a continous loop (with sleep) and checking the time
    - look into https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/howto/custom-management-commands/#module-django.core.management in the future
